/** A main service loop.
 * This class provides a service loop monitoring a set of file descriptors
 * using the classic POSIX pselect() API. Therefore it is not suitable for
 * thousands of concurrent clients. It is designed for portability with few
 * dependencies and will work fine with up to a few hundred file descriptors.
 *
 * Status changes on file descriptors are published as events. It also offers
 * a configurable periodic "tick" event and handles standard signals (SIGINT
 * and SIGTERM) for termination.
 *
 * Finally, there's a panic function to quickly exit the loop and still give a
 * chance for some (minimal) cleanup.
