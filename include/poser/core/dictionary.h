/** A dictionary storing any data objects using any type of keys.
 * Keys are interpreted as arrays of bytes of a specified size, so any object
 * stored in contiguous memory can be used as a key. For a string key, just
 * pass the string length as the size.
 *
 * This works internally as a structure of nested hash tables. A 64bit hash
 * function (currently xxHash 3) is used to calculate a hash of the given key.
 * The root of a PSC_Dictionary is a hash table with 256 entries, using the
 * lowest 8 bits of the hash. On collissions, a second level hash table with
 * another 256 entries is created, using the next 8 bits of the hash.
 *
 * Further collissions in a second-level table will create more child tables,
 * but only with 16 entries, using another 4 bits of the hash, which is
 * repeated until there are no bits of the hash left. If this is ever reached,
 * collissions are resolved using a linked list for the affected bucket of the
 * innermost hash table.
